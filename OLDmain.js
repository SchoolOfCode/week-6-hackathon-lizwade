 * I love a margarita, and for some years now I've been trying to drink one in as many parts of the world as I can.
 * 
 * Sometimes I get a bit tipsy and forget where I've been.
 * 
 * Your task is, for any given position on a world map (represented by latitude and longitude), to remind me when I was nearest to that spot with a margarita in my hand.
 * 
 * Write a function that returns the date, as a string in the format yyyy-mm-dd, of the nearest margarita 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Some examples:
 * 
 * getDateOfNearestMargarita(STUFFHERE, STUFFHERE, logbook) should return 20170402, because that was the date I had a margarita in Jerusalem
 *

// I love a margarita, and for some years now I've been trying to drink one in as many parts of the world as I can.
// I want to identify the weak spots in my global margarita coverage, so I can plan my next holiday accordingly.
// Your task is to calculate the "Margarita Proximity" for any given position on a world map (represented by latitude and longitude)
// Write a function that returns the distance (units??) from the point provided to the nearest margarita recorded in my margarita logbook
// export function calculateMargaritaProximity(longitute, latitude, logbook) {
