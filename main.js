/**
 *
 * I love a margarita, and for some years now I've been keeping a log of the various specimens I've sampled in different cities.
 *
 * Your task is, for any given date, to find which bar I was drinking margaritas in on the closest date to the given date, ie the fewest days away.
 * If there is a tie, give me the name of the bar that served me the tastier margarita of the two (the one I gave the highest rating to).
 *
 * The date will be provided in a string in the format YYYY-MM-DD. You don't need to worry about time of day or timezones, just number of days.
 *
 * You will need the information in margarita_log. Your function should return the name of the bar as a string.
